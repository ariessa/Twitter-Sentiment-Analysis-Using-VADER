# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using VADER

Twitter is known as a platform for opinion sharing through posting tweets, retweeting, or liking tweets. As such, I used VADER
(Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) to perform sentiment analysis on texts gathered from Twitter. VADER is a
simple rule-based model that was created specifically for sentiment analysis on social media. This is because it takes slangs, short words and emoticons into account.
